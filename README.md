# Kingdom Simulator

Single window Python application for ruling and expanding a fantasy kingdom.

## Features

- **Character Creation** – Define the ruler's name, kingdom title, and signature trait.
- **Kingdom Dashboard** – View core stats, advance the turn, collect taxes, and host festivals.
- **Law Council** – Pass data-driven laws that modify food, gold, and stability outcomes.
- **Food Management** – Balance agricultural priorities against population consumption.
- **Population Policies** – Adjust rations and morale across peasants, artisans, nobles, and soldiers.
- **Army & Weapons Oversight** – Train armies, assign researched weapon technologies, and unlock new gear.
- **Conquest Planner** – Launch campaigns to annex neighbouring regions and gain prestige.
- **Era Progression** – Progress through five eras once enough prestige is accumulated.
- **Cheat Console** – Built-in commands for experimentation (`add_gold`, `add_food`, `unlock_weapon`, `win_conquest`, `set_era`).

All gameplay systems coexist inside a single Tkinter window with a navigation sidebar so no pop-up dialogs are required.

## Getting Started

```bash
python app.py
```

Python 3.9+ is recommended. No external dependencies beyond the standard library are required.
